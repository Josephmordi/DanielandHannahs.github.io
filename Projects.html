      <h3>Depression cases</h3>
      <p>	Quite a number of cases of depression have come to us, and still on the increase, we traced causative factors to peer pressure, <p>unfulfilled spiritual atmosphere especially in local church expressions, <p>studying courses in higher institutions that they never were in love with-societal and parental influence  are the most pressure point etc...
<p>Cases caused by economic down turn of many homes, <p>parents in ability to meet basic needs such as..school fees, <p>kids are forced to skip a session or terms at school and stay home. <p>We have proffered school fees payment through crowd funding for 3 youths and they were very grateful.

    <h3>Cultism and bullying at school</h3>
    <p>We have just a few cases on this, but have not paid much attention because of limited manpower,
    but are watching its trajectory closely.
    <p>We gave shelter in the safe house until such persons were armed with requisite skills to overcome their unique and peculiar cases with real life practical approaches.
    <p>We are to say there is a success story on it already....
