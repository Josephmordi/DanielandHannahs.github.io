<ul>It is a 4 bedroom flat at the cost of N350 000 per year, 2kitchenet, toilets, bathrooms, a store, spacious seating room for rest, recreation and training sessions.
<p>The place has a many purposes; as a contact and reference office, monthly contact training and praying session, the bedrooms/dorms are made such a way that any youth is at liberty to book to have a session of quiet time with the Lord, its also a Minister/Missionary training and retreat centre.
<p>MISSION SAFE HOUSE PROJECT* is meant for all children of God irrespective of their denomination, itâ€™s a sort of *REHOBOTH*. Adults are free to come and hide under the serene environment and have a time of waiting alone with God, its en-suite. Most parents having challenges with teens/youths/wards can in partnership with us ask such ward to come spend a weekend/short holiday vacation with us (our assignment is quiet but potent), an encounter with this facility and compassion behind the mission safe house project will impart the child in no small way.
